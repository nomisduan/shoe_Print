## üöß TestFlight Deployment Issue

### Current Issue: HealthKit Validation Error
**Problem**: TestFlight validation fails due to "NS Health data update" access concern.

### Investigation & Solution
**Root Cause**: App currently only requests read permissions (`NSHealthShareUsageDescription`) but TestFlight validator may be incorrectly flagging the app.

**Immediate Actions**:
- [ ] Verify no `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription` in project settings
- [ ] Review permission description text for clarity
- [ ] Ensure HealthKit entitlements specify read-only access
- [ ] Update permission description to explicitly mention "read-only" access

**Current Permission Description**:
```
"ShoePrint uses your step count and walking distance data from the Health app to associate your physical activity with specific pairs of shoes, helping you track how much each pair is used over time."
```

**Suggested Revision**:
```
"ShoePrint reads your step count and walking distance data from the Health app (read-only access) to track which shoes you wear during different activities, helping you monitor shoe usage and make informed purchasing decisions."
```

### Implementation Notes
- App only uses `typesToRead` in HealthKit authorization
- No write operations (`toShare: []`) are performed
- All data processing is local and read-only
- Consider adding explicit "read-only" language to permission descriptions
