ARCHITECTURE DEEP DIVE - ShoePrint iOS App
CONTEXT:
ShoePrint is a sustainable footwear tracking iOS app (SwiftUI + SwiftData + HealthKit). I'm a student at Apple Developer Academy Naples working on this portfolio project. I have failing computed properties and suspect the issue stems from architectural approach rather than individual calculations.
CRITICAL ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE:

FAILING COMPUTED PROPERTIES


Computed properties not updating/triggering
Suspected MVVM violations or circular dependencies
Data flow issues: HealthKit → ViewModel → Views → SwiftData


ARCHITECTURE SCALABILITY CONCERNS


Current hourly data aggregation: is this the right granularity?
Future flexibility: what if I want real-time or sub-hourly data?
Performance vs flexibility trade-offs in current implementation


SWIFTDATA + HEALTHKIT INTEGRATION


Timing issues between HealthKit authorization and data fetching
Complex relationships: Shoe ↔ ShoeSession ↔ StepEntry
"A posteriori attribution" session logic complexity

SPECIFIC ANALYSIS REQUESTS:
PHASE 1 - ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
□ Audit all computed properties in Models/ - identify which ones fail and why
□ Trace complete data flow from HealthKit through ViewModels to UI
□ Identify MVVM pattern violations and tight coupling issues
□ Analyze SwiftData relationship loading and cascade behavior
PHASE 2 - GRANULARITY & SCALABILITY REVIEW
□ Challenge current hourly aggregation approach - is this optimal?
□ Design more flexible data structure for variable granularity
□ Assess performance implications of finer-grained data
□ Propose architecture that supports real-time AND batch processing
PHASE 3 - ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS
□ Refactor computed properties with proper reactive patterns
□ Optimize HealthKit integration timing and error handling
□ Streamline session attribution logic for better maintainability
□ Implement clean separation of concerns across MVVM layers
TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVE QUESTIONS:
DATA ARCHITECTURE:

Is hourly aggregation limiting future feature development?
Should we store raw HealthKit samples and aggregate on-demand?
How to balance storage efficiency vs query flexibility?

COMPUTED PROPERTIES:

Which specific properties in Shoe.swift are failing?
Are @ObservableObject/@StateObject properly configured?
Any retain cycles in ViewModel → Model relationships?

SESSION MANAGEMENT:

Is "a posteriori attribution" over-engineered?
Can temporal session logic be simplified without losing functionality?
How to prevent overlapping session conflicts?

PERFORMANCE:

Are we over-optimizing with hourly batching?
What's the real performance cost of finer granularity?
Where are the actual bottlenecks in the current implementation?

DELIVERABLES EXPECTED:

DIAGNOSTIC REPORT


Root cause analysis of failing computed properties
Architecture assessment: strengths/weaknesses/bottlenecks
Granularity trade-off analysis with recommendations
Performance benchmarking of current vs proposed approaches


REFACTORED CODE


Fixed computed properties with proper data flow
More flexible data aggregation system
Cleaner MVVM separation and dependency management
Enhanced SwiftData relationships with better performance


ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS


Data granularity strategy for current + future needs
Scalable HealthKit integration patterns
Session management simplification opportunities
Performance optimization roadmap

CONSTRAINTS & CONTEXT:

Apple Developer Academy portfolio project - code quality matters
SwiftUI + SwiftData modern stack (no UIKit/CoreData legacy)
TestFlight deployment requirements (read-only HealthKit permissions)
Sustainability mission - architecture should reflect product quality

CLAUDE CODE INSTRUCTIONS:
START with computed properties failure analysis - this is the main pain point
CHALLENGE the hourly aggregation assumption - propose alternatives
FOCUS on scalable, maintainable solutions over quick fixes
PROVIDE concrete Swift/SwiftUI code examples
OPTIMIZE for portfolio-quality code that impresses recruiters
DOCUMENT all architectural decisions and trade-offs made
